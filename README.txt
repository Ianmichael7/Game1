Simple Platformer in Python
=================

Introduction
------------

I made a simple platformer:
- You can move with the left and right keys.
- Touch the white snow monsters and you lose health.
- Press the enter button to shoot your green alien snow monsters!
- Press space to jump, can help you get up to those higher platforms.
- While on a higher platform, hold down and press enter to jump down from the platform.
- If you reach a health of 0, the map resets!

It's a toy, have fun with it! You'll find out what happens when you kill the snow monsters!

Good luck at achieving a high score!

Game is based off of Maplestory type art and motion!
